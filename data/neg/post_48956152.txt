This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Isn't that fantastic? In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Let's get wild today. That's crazy. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Get tough with it, get strong. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Now then, let's play. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.
