this is m last communique down the supper highway all that I have left to say in a single tome. If I could give it all away will it come back to me someday like a needle in the hay or an expensive stone. But I got a reson to declaim the applications are to blame for all my sorrow an my pain a feeling so alone. I got too many friends too many people that I'll never meet and I'll never be there for I'll never be there for cause I'll never be there. Placebo 2013
